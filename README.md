# TIC_TAC_TOE
Simple AI

This is the result of capstone project from a Python course, in theory the project was to program a TIC TAC TOE game for two players, but I went further and programmed a game where you  play with a simple AI, there's only one way to beat the machine, I done it like this in purpose, in this way it was more interesting to play! 

This program was made before I started some other lessons as Classes, Modules and package... So, the code it's not well structured, if i have enough time I will structure it with classes!
